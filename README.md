This project aims to recognize handwritten digits without using PyTorch or TensorFlow. It implements a neural network at the most basic level. Although it is partially functional, future updates with network tweaks are planned.

Upcoming Changes:
1.Proper arrangement and restructuring of the code.
2.Improved accuracy and reliability of results.
3.Detailed documentation of the code and its usability.
4.Integration of the CUDA platform to enhance speed and efficiency.
Note: This project is still in its development stages and uses very primitive methods to perform all operations.

Additional Note: The roadmap is not strictly sequential; updates may be pushed out of order as they are completed.

Temporary Implementation: Currently, some PyTorch code is used for functionality. This will be phased out in future updates.
