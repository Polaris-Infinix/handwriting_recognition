This is a project which tries to recognize the the handwritten digits without any Pytorch or Tensorflow. 
This deals with the neural network in the most basic level, though its working partially, future updates with tweaks to the network are coming. 

Upcoming changes;
1. Proper arrangement of the code and restructing of the code
2. Proper results of the code
3. Proper details of the code and their usability
4. Implementation of the CUDA platform to increase the speed and effiency


Note- This is still in development stages and uses very primitive methods to permorm all the operations 

Note 2- The roadmap isn't followed in the given order, it can be changed and some updates are pushed faster if they are done
